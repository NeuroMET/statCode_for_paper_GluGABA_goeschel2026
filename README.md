# Longitudinal 7T MRS of Glutamate and GABA in Alzheimer’s Disease

This repository contains the analysis code supporting the manuscript:

Göschel et al., 2026, "Longitudinal 7T MRS Study of Glutamate and GABA Dynamics in Alzheimer's Disease Progression: From hyper- to hypoexcitation".

## Overview
We analyzed longitudinal 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data to investigate
stage-dependent trajectories of glutamate and GABA across the Alzheimer’s disease continuum.
Analyses were performed using linear mixed-effects models with natural splines.

## Reproducibility
Due to data protection regulations, raw participant data cannot be shared.
However, all statistical models, preprocessing steps, and figure-generation code are provided.

## Software
- R version: 4.5.1, R Core Team, 2025
- Key packages: lme4, emmeans, tidyverse, ggplot2
